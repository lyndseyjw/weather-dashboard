## A Weather Dashboard Where User Can Save City Searches &amp; See Current Weather As Well As A 5-Day Forecast

## Overview

This was a fun challenge in dynamically changing the DOM via Javascript & wonderful practice applying my backend skills using API fetch requests. I gained valuable experience analyzing data so I could traverse the objects & arrays returned from the requests in order to dispaly the desired content on the webpage. Users can search for current & future weather in cities anywhere in the world. The UI responds to their searches & is aware of the current date the user is in, allowing for a variety of responses based on timezone. 

Creating dynamic websites such as this is a great way to incentivize users to continue returning as the webpage appears to be tailored solely for them. All of their search histories are shown on the page & will be there when they return, even after quitting the screen. They can always return to their previous searches & see all of the cities they had previously searched.

The use of emojis is a visually appealing way for the user to connect to the weather conditions & the dynamic color pertaining to the severity of the UV Index is another way users can interpret the information visually.

The page has been styled with accessiblity in mind - the color scheme was chosen to satisy a large range of audiences.
