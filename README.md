## A Weather Dashboard Where User Can Save City Searches &amp; See Current Weather As Well As A 5-Day Forecast

## User Story

As a user traveling to different cities, I want to check the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast so I may plan my trip accordingly.

## Features

Using the Weather Dashboard app, users can search for cities & find the current weather as well as a 5-Day Foreceast. Their searches will save to the page so they can simply access them at a later time, even upon page reload & browser shutdown. <br/>
<br/>
Upon searching for a city, users are presented with a weather icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity, & UV Index for the current day as well as for the next 5 days.<br/>
<br/>
The use of emojis is a visually appealing way for the user to connect to the weather conditions & the dynamic color pertaining to the severity of the UV Index is another way users can interpret the information visually.<br/>
<br/>
The page has been styled with accessiblity in mind - the color scheme was chosen to satisy a large range of audiences.

## Author Notes

This was a fun challenge in dynamically manipulating the DOM via Javascript & a wonderful practice applying my backend skills using API fetch requests. I gained valuable experience analyzing data so I could traverse the objects & arrays returned from the requests in order to dispaly the desired content on the webpage. Users can search for current & future weather in cities anywhere in the world. The UI responds to their searches & is aware of the current date, allowing for a variety of responses based on timezone. 

Creating dynamic websites such as this is a great way to incentivize users to continue returning as the webpage appears to be tailored solely for them. All of their search histories are shown on the page & will be there when they return, even after quitting the screen. They can always return to their previous searches & see all of the cities they had previously searched.
